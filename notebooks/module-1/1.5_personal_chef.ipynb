      "Nice—leftover chicken and rice are great building blocks. Here are a few simple ideas that work well:\n",

      "- Chicken fried rice (quick weeknight option)\n",
      "  - Why it fits: uses day-old rice, chopped chicken, and a few veggies for a fast pan meal.\n",
      "  - Quick outline: sauté onion/garlic, add chicken, stir in rice, push to side, scramble in a couple of eggs, mix in peas or other veg, season with soy sauce.\n",
      "  - Time: about 15–20 minutes.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Creamy chicken and rice casserole\n",
      "  - Why it fits: great for using up chicken and rice plus a creamy sauce; makes leftovers easy to reheat.\n",
      "  - Quick outline: combine chicken, rice, a creamy sauce (cream of chicken soup or homemade white sauce), cheese, and bake until bubbly.\n",
      "  - Time: about 40–60 minutes.\n",
      "  - Source inspiration: Crazy for Crust – Easy Chicken and Rice Casserole\n",
      "  - Link: https://www.crazyforcrust.com/chicken-and-rice-casserole/\n",
      "\n",
      "- One-pan garlic herb chicken and rice skillet\n",
      "  - Why it fits: simple, one-pot meal with minimal cleanup; you can customize with any veggies you have.\n",
      "  - Quick outline: sauté onion, garlic, add chicken pieces to warm, stir in rice and broth, season with herbs, simmer until everything is heated through and the flavors meld.\n",
      "  - Time: about 25–35 minutes.\n",
      "  - Source idea (one-pan style, commonly shared): inspired by common “leftover chicken and rice skillet” ideas such as a simple pan method from The Recipe Critic’s style posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Leftover chicken and rice “egg fried” rice variation\n",
      "  - Why it fits: adds protein and texture with eggs; great if you have peas, carrots, scallions.\n",
      "  - Quick outline: similar to fried rice, but you scramble eggs in and toss in leftover rice and chicken with vegetables and soy sauce.\n",
      "  - Time: about 15–20 minutes.\n",

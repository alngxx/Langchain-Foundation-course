      "- Name: Lunopolis (also called the Spire City)\n",
      "- Location: tucked into a shielded lava-tube corridor along the southern pole, near the Shackleton crater rim; daylight is harvested and channeled through mirrored galleries to keep the city bright without relying on a fragile surface atmosphere.\n",
      "- Government: constitutional lunar federation; the Chancellor presides over the Lunar Council (twelve representatives) with an independent judiciary and a Lunar Directorate for security and infrastructure.\n",
      "- Population: roughly 4 million residents\n",
      "- Economy: Helium‑3 and water-ice extraction, solar power farms, precision manufacturing, and biotech research that thrives in the stable 1/6 g environment\n",
      "- Architecture: a mosaic of translucent basalt domes, 3D-printed regolith structures, and latticework corridors; magnetically levitated transit weaves between districts; windows and skylights orchestrate controlled daylight inside the lava-tube network\n",
      "- Landmarks: The Orbital Spire (seat of government), Daystar Dome (city-wide solar observatory and festival hall), Lumen Gate (sculpted entry to the moon’s crust), and the Gardens of Microclimate (hydroponic farms that feed the city)\n",
      "- Districts and culture: The Market of Craters (trade hub), Cradle District (residential wedges), and the Moon Tide Festival, a celebration of resilience in a world of perpetual dawn and dusk\n",
      "- Life and vibe: a blend of high-tech utopia and rugged frontier spirit; life in Lunopolis centers on collaboration between scientists, engineers, artists, and explorers who live and work in the lunar subsurface\n",
      "- Flag and motto: a silver crescent cradling a sunburst on a pale blue field; motto: “Light Through Shadow”\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want Lunopolis tailored to a particular vibe (gritty frontier, glittering technocracy, or pastoral utopia), tell me the tone and I’ll reshape the city details.\n"
